# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

scikit-image is generally backwards compatible with few exceptions, so we
recommend users to always use the latest version.

We usually don't backport patches or fixes to previous versions. But we may
release minor versions with patches. In case of particular critical issues
exceptions may be made.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a serious vulnerability, please contact the
scikit-image core team at: <br>
skimage-core@discuss.scientific-python.org

We will evaluate your report and if necessary issue a fix and an advisory. If
the issue was previously undisclosed, we'll also mention your name in the
release notes.

## Responsible Disclosure

We may apply a responsible disclosure process to reported or otherwise
discovered vulnerabilities. We will usually do that for a critical
vulnerability, and only if we have a good reason to believe information about
it is not yet public.
