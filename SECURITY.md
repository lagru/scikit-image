# Reporting a security vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a serious vulnerability and don't feel
comfortable reporting it as a public issue on our bug tracker, please contact
the scikit-image core team at:

skimage-core@discuss.scientific-python.org

We will evaluate your report and if necessary try fix the issue.

## Supported Versions

scikit-image is generally backwards compatible with few exceptions, so we
recommend users to always use the latest version.

We usually don't backport patches or fixes to previous versions. But we may
release minor versions with patches. In case of particular critical issues
exceptions may be made.
